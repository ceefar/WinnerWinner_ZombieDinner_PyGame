# bugs list

[small-bug-bois]
- minus 10 in the y when adding gold (g>g), but seemingly random, believe this is an incorrectly placed rect tho it resolves itself most times so struggling to replicate 
- and its not big or frequent enough to warrant investigation imp

- small bug to fix after a g>g (gold > gold) stack in menu, adding a non stackable item will invalidate the next undo (which it shouldn't)
    - tho it will continue working fine afterwards


[big-bug-bois]
- 5 days (since starting) no major bug bois... phew
